This method is really interesting:
- part I:
	great video:
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBwZvr5jHAU
	if you like articles - read the first part:	
		https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/binary-exp.html

- part II:
	you'll need to implement the fermat's little theorem
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_little_theorem (know what it is)
	implementation:

	if you're curious about its proof, read this blog...
	if more interested, try to proove it yourself, then read multiple proofs
	(the combinatorial proof - proof using the binomial theorem - proof as a particulat case of Euler's theorem)
