The concept of matrix exponentiation (matrix to the power of n) is generally useful for finding the nth term of a linear recurrence relation in O(log(n)) time. Like finding the nth fibonacci number in logarithmic time.

resources for learning this concept:
- first, learn the concept of binary exponentiation (calculate power in logarithmic complexity):
